# UnoGame
To improve Software Engineer skills, creating this UNO Game to learn OOPS, Low-level Design, System Design(High-Level Design), Scalability, FrontEnd, BackEnd, DB, Distributed Systems, etc. 
Understanding of software components like CI/CD, automated testing, etc. 

## Aim:
1. To make a highly scalable UNO Web App.
2. Functionality-wise it should be at par with Online Games.
3. It should support 1 Million Users concurrently.
4. It should follow clean coding practices.
5. It should use open-source libraries.
6. Automate wherever necessary (tests, deployment, failover, etc.)
7. It should follow TDD (Test-driven development) approach. 

## Library & Tools used in the project:
1. flake8 = checking PEP8 style guide.
2. black = enforcing PEP8 style guide.
3. pre-commit = to inspect the snapshot just before committing.
4. mock = for mocking behaviours, useful in unit tests.
5. stestr = parallel python test runner for unit tests.
6. Travis CI = for continuous build, test & deploy.
7. tox = automated testing tool using virtualenv.
